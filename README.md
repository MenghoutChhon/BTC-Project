# 📈 BTC-Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **group effort by Menghout Chhon and Dok Dominique**, created as part of our coursework for the **Data Ethics and Privacy** module. The project focuses on **time series forecasting of Bitcoin (BTC) prices** using both **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks)** and **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)** models.

We aim to compare deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches for financial time series prediction.
